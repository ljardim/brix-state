# Brix State

Simple State Machine to drive Behaviour Actions

The Brix State package is built on top of the ScriptableObject-Architecture package found [here](https://github.com/DanielEverland/ScriptableObject-Architecture) and based on the behaviour editor done by [Athos Kele](www.sharpaccent.com).

ScriptableObject architecture based on [Ryan Hipple's 2017 Unite talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk)
