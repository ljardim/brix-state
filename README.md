# Brix State

Simple State Machine to drive Behaviours

The Brix State package is built on top of the Unity Atoms found [here](https://github.com/AdamRamberg/unity-atoms) and based on the behaviour editor done by [Athos Kele](www.sharpaccent.com).

ScriptableObject architecture based on [Ryan Hipple's 2017 Unite talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk)
